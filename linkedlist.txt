Advantages of linked list
	Linked List is Dynamic data Structure.
	You can change size of Linked List during program run time.
	Insertion and Deletion Operations are Easier, you can insert any node at any place and also delete any node easily..
	No memory wastage ,i.e no need to pre-allocate memory
	Faster Access time,can be expanded in constant time without memory overhead
	You can easily implement Linear Data Structures such as Stack,Queue using Linked list



typedef is used to define a data type in C.

malloc() is used to dynamically allocate a single block of memory in C, it is available in the header file stdlib.h.

sizeof() is used to determine size in bytes of an element in C. Here it is used to determine size of each node and sent as a parameter to malloc.
